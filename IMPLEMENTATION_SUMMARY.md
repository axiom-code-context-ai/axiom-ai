- ArchitectureExtractor: ~$0.10 (with docs) or $0 (inferred)
- DomainExtractor: ~$0.20
- PatternMiner: ~$1.00
- APISpecExtractor: ~$0.25
- **Total: ~$1.50 per repository**

### Runtime Query Performance
- Context assembly: <100ms (first query)
- Cached queries: <5ms
- Token budget: 8000 tokens (configurable up to 16K)
- Cache TTL: 1 hour
- Target cache hit rate: 60%+

## 🎯 How It Works

### End-to-End Flow

1. **Developer adds repository:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/extraction/trigger
   { "repository_id": "uuid", "git_url": "..." }
   ```

2. **Extraction pipeline runs:**
   ```
   Clone repo → RepositoryAnalyzer → [Parallel: 4 extractors] → Store results → Cleanup
   ```

3. **Developer writes code in Cursor:**
   ```
   User: "Add Stripe payment processing"
   ```

4. **Cursor calls MCP tool:**
   ```
   search_code_with_enterprise_context({ query: "Add Stripe payment processing" })
   ```

5. **Context assembler returns:**
   ```
   - Architecture: "Event-driven with async processing"
   - Domain: "Payment domain with entities: Payment, Transaction"
   - Patterns: "Use GingerClient (95% standard), builder pattern"
   - Standards: "Custom R1 framework, timeout required"
   - APIs: "Payment API v2.1.3 endpoints"
   ```

6. **Claude generates code:**
   - Follows event-driven architecture
   - Uses Payment domain entities
   - Implements with GingerClient (standard pattern)
   - Includes timeout configuration
   - Integrates with Payment API correctly

## 🔑 Key Innovations

### 1. Zero Git History Mining
Unlike competitors (Sourcegraph, Copilot), we extract knowledge from:
- Current codebase structure (Tree-sitter AST)
- Documentation files (ADRs, READMEs)
- Dependency manifests (pom.xml, package.json)
- Code patterns (frequency analysis)

**Benefits:**
- 10x faster extraction
- No git history size limitations
- Works with any git provider
- Lower storage requirements

### 2. Hierarchical Context Assembly
Four levels of context:
- Level 1: Architecture (WHY)
- Level 2: Domain (WHAT)
- Level 3: Patterns (HOW)
- Level 4: Standards (DON'T)

**Benefits:**
- Complete picture for AI
- Prevents anti-patterns
- Enforces company conventions
- Adapts to user intent

### 3. Pattern Frequency Analysis
Identifies "standard" patterns by usage:
- Pattern A: 95 occurrences → **STANDARD ✓**
- Pattern B: 3 occurrences → variant
- Pattern C: 2 occurrences → legacy

**Benefits:**
- No manual annotation needed
- Self-documenting codebase
- Detects consistency violations
- Guides new developers

### 4. Custom Framework Detection
Automatically finds internal frameworks:
- Package naming patterns (com.abc.*, @company/*)
- Component discovery (GingerClient, ABCRepository)
- Usage frequency tracking
- Configuration namespace detection

**Benefits:**
- Works for any company
- No hardcoded framework list
- Discovers tribal knowledge
- Scales to multiple frameworks
